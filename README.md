# Orbital Asteroids

A project to answer the question; what happens when you mix the 1979 classic [asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) with [orbital mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics)?

Written in 2019, before I understood the powers of git.

## Getting Started

Download [GoDot](https://godotengine.org/download) and open this project with it, use run or edit. Maybe later I will upload a compiled exe.

### Control Scheme

The aim is destroy as many space rocks before you get hit 2 times and die.

`a d` adjust your rotation

`w` forward thrust

`space bar` shoot

`enter` start game

`r` toggle the camera between relative and absolute mode

`i` toggle insaine mode, need to die to take effect
